One thing AI can genuinely give back—if we allow it to—is time. Not time to do more, but time to live more loosely inside what’s already there. When reading, researching, or gathering information no longer needs to absorb all of our energy, what remains is something quieter and harder to justify: enjoyment.  

I’ve been feeling this recently while reading Mishima’s Sea of Fertility tetralogy. Once the pressure to “extract” meaning or information recedes, reading becomes less about acquisition and more about staying with a texture—language, rhythm, atmosphere. The same text feels different when it’s no longer tasked with proving its usefulness. What’s left isn’t emptiness, but a kind of presence. You’re not trying to get somewhere. You’re just there.

Creation can feel similar. When it’s no longer driven by urgency or optimization, it begins to resemble play—not in a naïve sense, but in a sustained, attentive one. Making something because it needs to exist, not because it needs to perform. In that way, creation stops being a means to an end and becomes an experience in itself.

And yet, this is where things get complicated. There’s something in us—something almost masochistic—that resists this smoothing out. We don’t just endure friction; we often seek it. Difficulty becomes proof of seriousness. Exhaustion becomes evidence of commitment. We tell ourselves that work must hurt in order to matter. Ease, by contrast, can feel suspicious, even undeserved.

So the question isn’t simply whether AI can make work more efficient. It’s whether we can tolerate the space that efficiency opens up. Can we allow ourselves more leisure, more slack, more enjoyment—without immediately filling it back up with obligation? Can we let work become smoother without turning that smoothness into a new source of guilt?
